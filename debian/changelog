plasma-widget-networkmanagement (0.1~svn935902-0r1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream development snapshot:
    - Last Changed Author: wstephens
    - Last Changed Rev: 940405
    - Last Changed Date: 2009-03-17 15:14:21 +0200
  * Get rid of complicated dh_auto_* implementation for cmake (as it seems
    it is not going to be accepted upstream anyway). Write a simple cmake.mk
    instead and make kde4.mk use it.
  * Migrate debian/rules to dh_overrides. Build depend on debhelper 7.0.50.
