  * debian/control
    - Drop Build-Depends on libknotificationitem-1-dev which was merged and
      renamed in kde4libs 4.4. (Closes: #584360)
  * debian/rules
    - Set -DINSTALL_KNM_AUTOSTART=ON to enable installation of knetworkmanager
      autostart file.
  * Re-add plasma-widget-networkmanagement package.
  * Move the networkmanagement kded module from knm-runtime to
    plasma-widget-networkmanagement. The kded service is not used by
    knetworkmanager and actually breaks knetworkmanager due to being
    auto-loaded and claiming the NetworkManagerUserSettings bus name.
