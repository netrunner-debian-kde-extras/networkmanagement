networkmanagement (0.1+git20110422.810bc16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream Git snapshot 810bc16 (from master branch).
  * Make the package binNMUable against KDE SC 4.6:
    - build depend on mobile-broadband-provider-info and add it to knm-runtime
      Depends (KDE SC 4.6 only);
    - network.svgz is not shipped when plasma-widget-networkmanager is
      built against KDE SC 4.5. Install it only if it exists.
  * Rename source package to networkmanagement (according to the name of the
    upstream git repository).
  * Fix links to the upstream VCS repository in debian/copyright.
  * Point Vcs-* fields to the new location of packaging VCS.
  * Use my @debian.org address in debian/control and debian/copyright.
  * Update packaging section in debian/copyright.
  * Convert network-manager-kde to the transitional package for
    plasma-widget-networkmanagement.
  * Merge knm-runtime package into plasma-widget-networkmanager. It no longer
    makes sense after sunset of the network-manager-kde package.
  * Make some consmetic changes in debian/rules.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.2: no changes needed.
