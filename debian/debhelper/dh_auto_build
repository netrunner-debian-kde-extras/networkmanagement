=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dh_auto_build> [S<I<debhelper options>>] [S<B<--> I<params>>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

dh_auto_build is a debhelper program that tries to automatically
build a package. If a Makefile is found, this is done by running make (or
MAKE, if the environment variable is set).
If there's a setup.py, or Build.PL, it is run to build the package.

This is intended to work for about 90% of packages. If it doesn't work,
you're encouraged to skip using dh_auto_build at all, and just run the
build process manually.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--> I<params>

or override any standard parameters that dh_auto_build passes.
