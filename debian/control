Description: KDE NetworkManagement infrastructure runtime files
 This package contains runtime libraries and binaries needed by both
 network-manager-kde (knetworkmanager) and plasma-widget-networkmanagement
 packages. Currently, it provides interface to NetworkManager and the KDE4
 Control Module (kcm) for managing/storing network settings (to be used by
 either of the two support applications later).
 .
 It is possible to use this package without its frontends (either
 network-manager-kde or plasma-widget-networkmanagement). It enables
 notifications under KDE but actual network management functions will be very
 limited.
