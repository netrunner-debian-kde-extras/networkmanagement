This package uses git+topgit as the packaging VCS. Please install Debian topgit
package 0.5 or higher and read /usr/share/doc/topgit/HOWTO-tg2quilt.gz for more
information how to checkout, add, remove, modify patches (topic branches) and
do other common tasks. Branch structure of the repository is as follows:

* upstream   - upstream source code.
* master     - the Debianization branch (upstream source and debian directory).
               This branch also contains exported debian/patches ready for
               building.

Topic branches should be named as follows:

* general/*  - namespace for general upstream patches. Patches can be named
               freely, but it is recommended to suffix names with '_fix' for
               patches fixing bugs and with '_feature' for patches introducing
               new features. These patches should be based on the upstream
               branch.
* debian/*   - Debian specific patches should be put in this namespace. These
               patches should be based on the upstream branch or even master
               branch if necessary.

If a patch depends on any other patch(es), create/adjust its topic branch
dependencies as needed.

However, topgit is not a build dependency. Patches are exported to
debian/patches as quilt series before building. Please read
/usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source (quilt version 0.46-4.1 or later) for more
information on how to manage patches directly with quilt. Please note that this
method is not acceptable for long term package management, only for quick
patching.
